My Portfolio
==============

# About

This repository acts as a portfolio to highlight some of the software solutions I've developed over the years, everything from small scripts to large projects created alone or in collaboration with others. I will usually strip data and remove media files from portfolio items before publication, only keeping information relevant to demonstrate results and gained experience. If an item is made in collaboration with others, their names will be found in the authors section. Each portfolio item is contained within its own directory and I try to keep the content structure similar across all directories:

```

# Other Projects
