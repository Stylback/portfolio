My Portfolio

# About

This repository acts as a portfolio to highlight some of the software solutions I've developed over the years, everything from small scripts to large projects created alone or in collaboration with others. Each portfolio item is contained within its own directory and I try to keep the content structure similar across all directories:

```
portfolio
├── small-script
│   ├── script.ext
│   └── README.md
├── medium-project
│   ├── code
│   │   └──code.ext
│   └── README.md
├── large-project
│   ├── code
│   │   └──code.ext
│   ├── media
│   │   └──histogram.png
│   ├── report.pdf
│   └── README.md
└── README.md
```

Items only land in the portfolio after the associated project have been deemed completed and made public, I do not publish ongoing projects. I will usually strip data and media files from projects before portfolio publication, only keeping information relevant to demonstrate results. If a project is made in collaboration with others, their names will be found in the authors section.
